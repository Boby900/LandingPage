            <article>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
                professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin word</article>

                a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making
                it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum
